We have two trained models named:
model_986
model_9929

The first model is a model based on our custom model, while the second is based on RESNET 50. 
The models can be downloaded from:

# Testing
To test a model use the notebook `Test_model.ipynb` file. Running the CNN_Pipeline file might take a while as it is configured to train large models and it might take a while to see the results.

If anything goes wrong with the model download please contact:
